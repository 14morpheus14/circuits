# COCO's Collection of Circuits

**COCO** stands for *Collaborative Oblivious Computation for Orthogonal Authentication*. This collection of circuits is named in dedication to **Divya Jyoti Das** (alias: *Coco*), whose unwavering support and encouragement made this work possible. Currently, COCO Auth in itself does not utilize these circuits as we do not intend to consider email or SMS-based two-factor authentication due to privacy and security concerns. We recognize that such methods may still introduce potential points of failure and risk of privacy leaks, as a malicious authenticator could log personally identifiable information (PII) in the senderâ€™s email or SMS account. However, this repository has been provided to support possible future policy changes or to facilitate secure multiparty computations within COCO Auth as required. Thus, consider this a comprehensive repository of circuits that may serve future needs, and may constantly keep updating.

## Dependency Folders

- **aes**: Contains the `aes128_full.txt` circuit, required for generating AES in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) circuits.
- **sha**: Contains the `sha-256-multiblock-aligned.txt` circuit, required for generating TLS Handshake and Application-related circuits.

## Major Folders

- **aes-gcm**: This folder contains the circuit for AES-128 in GCM mode.
- **tlsv13**: This folder contains the circuits required for conducting a TLS v1.3 session (inclusive of SMTP over TLS).

## Important Notes

### Optimization and Industry Readiness

This work is not industry-ready and can be further optimized as required. The author is, therefore, not liable to any utilization of these circuits by anyone for any purposes. The circuits provided here can benefit from more efficient implementations of certain cryptographic operations using the EMP-toolkit. For example:
- **AES-128 in GCM**: Could utilize a more optimized implementation of Galois Field multiplication.
- **TLS v1.3 circuits**: Can take advantage of EMP-tool's Pseudo-Random Generator (PRG) to enhance efficiency and reduce redundancy.

However, these circuits work fine for our utility.

### Memory Leak Consideration

The memory leak issue in the [n-for-1-auth/circuits](https://github.com/n-for-1-auth/circuits) repository, fixed in commit `35135df7b05ad2c0cba3e0bfffea8641d6629a9e`, has been taken into account in this repository. The TLS cryptographic preliminary generation circuits are based on the version of that repository after this fix, ensuring improved memory management.

## Dedication

This work is lovingly dedicated to **Divya Jyoti Das** (*alias: Coco*), *Forensic Scientist*, whose constant support and encouragement were instrumental in its creation. The name **COCO** not only represents *Collaborative Oblivious Computation for Orthogonal Authentication* but also serves as a heartfelt tribute to her. This collection of circuits is part of an ongoing authentication library named **COCO**, a personal and professional dedication.
